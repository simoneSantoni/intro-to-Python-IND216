## Course Overview

IND216 - Introduction to Python for Analytics is designed specifically for MSc students in analytics who want to develop practical programming skills for data analysis. This course provides a foundation in Python programming with a focus on the tools and techniques most relevant to data science and analytics work.

## Learning Philosophy

This course takes a practical, hands-on approach to learning Python. Rather than covering every aspect of the language, we focus on the core concepts and libraries that analytics professionals use daily:

- **Practical Focus**: Learn by doing with real-world examples and exercises
- **Analytics-Oriented**: Emphasis on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
- **Progressive Learning**: Build skills incrementally from basic concepts to advanced applications
- **Modern Tools**: Use current best practices and industry-standard libraries

## Course Structure

The course is organized into five substantive modules:

### Module 1: Getting Started with Python
- Python installation and setup
- Development environments (Jupyter, VS Code)
- Basic syntax and programming concepts
- Writing and running Python scripts

### Module 2: Python Objects
- Data types (numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries)
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modules
- File handling and I/O operations

### Module 3: Technical & Scientific Computation with NumPy
- Introduction to NumPy arrays
- Array operations and broadcasting
- Mathematical functions and linear algebra
- Performance considerations for numerical computing

### Module 4: Data Management with Pandas
- DataFrames and Series
- Reading and writing data files
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Grouping, merging, and reshaping data

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Set up and manage Python environments** for data analysis projects
2. **Write clean, efficient Python code** using best practices
3. **Manipulate and analyze data** using NumPy arrays for numerical computing
4. **Process and transform datasets** using Pandas DataFrames
5. **Develop reproducible data analysis workflows** from raw data to insights
6. **Debug and troubleshoot** common programming issues
7. **Apply object-oriented programming concepts** where appropriate for analytics tasks

## Prerequisites

- **No prior programming experience required**
- Basic computer literacy (file management, using applications)
- Willingness to learn through trial and error
- Access to a computer for hands-on practice

## Software Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (we recommend Python 3.9 or 3.10)
- **Anaconda distribution** (includes Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, and other essential packages)
- **Text editor or IDE** (Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or PyCharm)
- **Git** for version control (optional but recommended)

## Assessment and Practice

This course emphasizes practical skill development through:

- **Interactive exercises** embedded in each module
- **Hands-on coding assignments** using real datasets
- **Progressive projects** that build on previous concepts
- **Self-assessment opportunities** to check understanding

## Getting Help

- Use the course materials and examples as your first reference
- Practice with the provided exercises and datasets
- Consult Python documentation and community resources
- Ask questions during class sessions or office hours

## Success Tips

1. **Practice regularly**: Programming is a skill that improves with consistent practice
2. **Start small**: Begin with simple examples and gradually tackle more complex problems
3. **Read error messages**: They often contain helpful information about what went wrong
4. **Use online resources**: The Python community has excellent documentation and tutorials
5. **Don't be afraid to experiment**: Try different approaches and see what works
