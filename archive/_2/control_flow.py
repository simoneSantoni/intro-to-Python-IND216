    + the if statement

"""

# %% the if statement

"""
Few computer programs are executed in a purely linear fashion, one
statement after another as written in the source code. It is more likely that
during the program execution, data objects are inspected and blocks of code
executed conditionally on the basis of some test carried out on them. Thus,
all practical languages have the equivalent of an if-then-(else) construction.
(Hill, 2015).
