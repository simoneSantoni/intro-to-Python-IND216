**Q: Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT?**
A: You may use them for learning and understanding concepts, but submitted code must be your own work. Always cite any assistance received.

**Q: What if I'm falling behind?**
A: Seek help immediately. The course builds on itself, so early gaps become bigger problems later.

**Q: Do I need a powerful computer?**
A: No, basic Python programming doesn't require much computing power. Any computer from the last 5 years should work fine.
