## Getting Started with Python - Exercises

These exercises will help you practice the concepts covered in Module 1.

### Exercise 1.1: Environment Setup Verification

Verify that your Python environment is correctly set up:

```python
# Run this code to check your setup
import sys
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
```

**Expected output**: You should see version numbers for Python (3.9+), NumPy, and Pandas.

### Exercise 1.2: Basic Python Operations

Complete the following tasks:

```python
# Task 1: Create variables of different types
# Your code here

# Task 2: Perform arithmetic operations
# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5
# Your code here

# Task 3: String manipulation
# Create a greeting message using string formatting
name = "Your Name"
# Your code here

# Task 4: Create a list of your favorite programming languages
# Your code here
```

### Exercise 1.3: Interactive Python

Practice using Python interactively:

1. Open a Python shell or Jupyter notebook
2. Calculate the following:
   - 2 raised to the power of 10
   - The square root of 144
   - The remainder when 17 is divided by 5

3. Import the `math` module and use it to calculate:
   - The value of pi
   - The sine of 45 degrees (remember to convert to radians)
   - The natural logarithm of 10

### Exercise 1.4: Creating Your First Script

Create a Python script called `hello_analytics.py` that:

1. Prints a welcome message
2. Asks for the user's name
3. Asks for their favorite number
4. Calculates and displays the square of that number
5. Says goodbye with their name

**Sample interaction**:
```
Welcome to Python for Analytics!
What's your name? Alice
What's your favorite number? 7
Alice, the square of 7 is 49
Goodbye, Alice!
```

### Exercise 1.5: Working with Files

Create a Python script that:

1. Creates a new text file called `data.txt`
2. Writes the numbers 1 through 10 (each on a new line)
3. Closes the file
4. Opens the file again for reading
5. Reads and prints each line
6. Calculates and prints the sum of all numbers

### Challenge Problems

#### Challenge 1: Temperature Converter

Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c):
    # Your code here
    pass

def fahrenheit_to_celsius(f):
    # Your code here
    pass

def celsius_to_kelvin(c):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test your functions
print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0))    # Should print 32.0
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(98.6)) # Should print 37.0
print(celsius_to_kelvin(25))       # Should print 298.15
```

#### Challenge 2: Simple Calculator

Create an interactive calculator that:
- Offers operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Handles division by zero gracefully
- Continues until the user chooses to quit

### Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new folder called `module1_exercises`
2. Save all your Python scripts in this folder
3. Include comments explaining your code
4. Test all your solutions before submission

### Self-Assessment Checklist

Before moving to Module 2, ensure you can:

- [ ] Run Python code in multiple ways (script, interactive, Jupyter)
- [ ] Create and manipulate variables
- [ ] Perform basic arithmetic operations
- [ ] Work with strings
- [ ] Write and run Python scripts
- [ ] Import and use modules
- [ ] Read from and write to files
- [ ] Use basic input/output functions

### Additional Practice

If you finish early or want extra practice:

1. Explore the Python documentation for the `random` module
2. Write a program that generates random numbers
3. Create a simple number guessing game
4. Experiment with different string methods
5. Try creating functions with multiple parameters

### Getting Help

Remember:
- Check the error messages carefully
- Use `help()` and `dir()` functions
- Consult the course resources
- Ask on the forum if stuck
- Attend office hours for personalized help
