## Welcome to IND216

This interactive website provides a comprehensive five-part introduction to Python programming specifically designed for MSc students in analytics. The course emphasizes practical data wrangling skills using Python's technical and scientific computing ecosystem.

## Course Overview

Rather than attempting an exhaustive coverage of Python's features, this course focuses on building a solid foundation in:

- Core Python programming concepts
- Data manipulation fundamentals  
- Scientific computing with NumPy
- Data analysis with Pandas

## What You'll Learn

Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Write Python scripts for data processing tasks
- Manipulate and analyze data using NumPy arrays
- Perform data wrangling operations with Pandas DataFrames
- Develop reproducible data analysis workflows

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. The course is designed to take students from zero coding knowledge to practical data analysis skills.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into five main modules:

1. **[Course Information](course-info.qmd)** - Course overview and learning approach
2. **[Getting Started with Python](getting-started.qmd)** - Installation, environments, and running programs
3. **[Python Objects](python-objects.qmd)** - Data types, control flow, and basic programming constructs
4. **[Technical & Scientific Computation with NumPy](numpy-computation.qmd)** - Array operations and numerical computing
5. **[Data Management with Pandas](pandas-data.qmd)** - DataFrames and data manipulation

## Getting Started

To begin your Python journey, start with the [Course Information](course-info.qmd) section to understand the learning approach, then proceed through each module sequentially.

Each section includes interactive examples, code snippets, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.
