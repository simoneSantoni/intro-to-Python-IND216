macro:->If
encoding
is
not
specified
the
encoding
used
is
platform-dependent.
Specifically,
\texttt
{locale.getpreferredencoding(False)}
is
called
to
get
the
current
locale
encoding.
Character
encoding
is
the
process
of
assigning
numbers
to
graphical
characters,
especially
the
written
characters
of
human
language,
allowing
them
to
be
stored,
transmitted,
and
transformed
using
digital
computers.
