is
an
interesting
passage
from
the
official
\href
{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/glossary.html##term-vectorization}{NumPy}
documentation:
\textit
{NumPy
hands
off
array
processing
to
C,
where
looping
and
computation
are
much
faster
than
in
Python.
To
exploit
this,
programmers
using
NumPy
eliminate
Python
loops
in
favor
of
array-to-array
operations.
vectorization
can
refer
both
to
the
C
offloading
and
to
structuring
NumPy
code
to
leverage
it.}
